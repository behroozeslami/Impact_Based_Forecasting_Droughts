ROAD SECTOR:
Affected roads included: Odoot-Olupe road, Orungo corner-Adakar
BRIDGES:
Ajeleki Bridge has become dangerous for vehicles to use.
The distance between Angisa and Magoro over Omunyo swamp (10km) is flooded, subsequently people have introduced canoes/boats over some sections.

EFFECTS ON COMMUNITY:
The situation has affected the community in that 8 couples have seperated.

EDUCATION:
The education sector has been affected by impassable roads.Teaching hours have greatly reduced, reduced attendance because of absentism and late coming.
17 Primary schools have water logged latrines whereas 4 schools are almost inaccessible.
Night commuters use school facilities thus straining them and posing a health threat to the school community and this arises from poor waste management and disposal.

WATER SECTOR:
Only one water source has remained uncontaminated due to water logging as revealed by the Water Department. Disinfection of all water sources has been carried out.

HEALTH SECTOR:
There has been increased incidences of malaria, cholera diarrhoea and guinea worms.
Angisa is cut off from the main land with no health facility."
